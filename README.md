Doing completion using OpenAI in PHP - easily configurable. (works in 01.2023)

I wanted to have a quick PHP implementation for doing completion using OpenAI (GPT3 or anything else accessible through API).

And I have done it ! 

index.php is where the magic happens (where you put in the prompt)
openAI.php is where you put in your API Key (change function API_KEY()) , 
also function configuration() permits you to adit your openAI settings like temperature, topp, presence_penalty, frequence_penalty, best_of, stream.

to run it
php index.php

And.. you will get something ! (pending you have your API key set)

works with php7.2, using openAI API (on the date of 30.01.2023)

enjoy
